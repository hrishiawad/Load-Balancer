The "Configuring and Optimizing the different types of Load Balancer for efficiently manage different types of Traffic" 
focuses on exploring and configuring different types of load balancers in AWS to efficiently manage incoming traffic. 
To start with configuring the Classic Load Balancer and creating multiple EC2 instances with restricted access for security. 
Subsequently, the Application Load Balancer is configured with path-based routing to direct traffic based on URL paths. 
Followed EC2 instances are provisioned with web servers to showcase different webpage paths, aligning with path-based routing for different traffic engagement. 
Finally, target groups are configured to ensure efficient routing of traffic. 
This helps in AWS load balancer management, security implementation, 
and advanced routing strategies to optimize application performance and enhance system reliability andÂ scalability.
